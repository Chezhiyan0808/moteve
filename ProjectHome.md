This project aims to allow anybody to capture videos and stream them up to server so that the rest of the world can watch them live.

The project consists of 2 basic parts:
1) the server side
2) the client side

The server side is responsible for accepting the media stream from clients, its further processing, security, etc. and finally for allowing people to watch the contents.

The client part typically runs on mobile phones and serves as a camcorder and media uploader. As there are many kinds of clients (e.g. in mobile phones several vendors and models), there will be created more client alternatives.
